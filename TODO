Better looking input file inspired from AVL
Call all input files as .in and output files as .out/.dat/.curve
Read rotor input data using rotor_class subroutine with input files named as rotorxx.in
Logical input arrangement inside rotorxx.in files
BLADE DIMENSIONS - Nb, chord_switch, radius, root_cut, hub_coords, CG_coords
chord - [i/s] @(ns+1) points
MOTION - Omega as vector, uvw_body, pqr_body,
CONTROL - Pitch inputs, twist_switch
twist - [i/s] @(ns+1) points
VORTEX CORE RADII - [i/s] @(ns+1) points
core radii

Order of execution
===================
main executes
read 'init_file.f90' with allocatable variables and all other variables
read 'config.in' file containing nr, nt, feature_switches
read each 'rotor??.in' file containing specific rotor data
allocate variables accordingly
continue execution of main.f90 file
