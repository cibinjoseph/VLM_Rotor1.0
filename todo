Max circulation at non max lift in forward flight?
Does discretization give rise to instability? cause for Kelvin waves or Crow instability?
Make lift integration higher order - unequal intervals
Check oscillations in inflow - dependent on nInflowLocations
Check if vortex strain is overriding vortex core changes due to dissipation
Wake dissipation on extreme straining
Try slow start for tandem wing to check for discrepancy
Convert grid output to binary format
Implement non-lifting surfaces: 
- Use source induced velocity for non-lifting surfaces in vind
Check sweep cases by KnP
While computing drag from FELS in unsteady case, ensure unsteady 'induced' drag term is not counted twice by neglecting it in force computation using gamma 
Introduce blade%xAxisNoPitch centered about pitching hinge
Implement alpha sweep mode
Compute blade flap moment and rotor moments
Add provision for root vortex
Phase out invertGammaSign since it works incorrectly for cambered sections
Create output folder with nonlinear data
Implement prescribed far-wake
Implement wake truncation
Read alpha0 to params.json
