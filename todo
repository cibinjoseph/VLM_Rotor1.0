Max circulation at non max lift in forward flight?
Check leapfrogging in vortex rings - dependance on discretization
Does discretization give rise to instability? cause for Kelvin waves or Crow instability?
Check performance using VTune Amplifier and Advisor
Check CT and inflow distribution against BEMT
Split Nwake and Fwake computations to separate loops to avoid if conditions
Try slowstart to prevent starting vortex instability
Get blade distributed parameters
Add forces to single file, use appending
