Max circulation at non max lift in forward flight?
Does discretization give rise to instability? cause for Kelvin waves or Crow instability?
Check performance using VTune Amplifier and Advisor
Split Nwake and Fwake computations to separate loops to avoid if conditions
Try slowstart to prevent starting vortex instability
Get blade distributed parameters, at quarter chord maybe?
Make lift integration higher order - unequal intervals
Check oscillations in inflow - dependent on nInflowLocations

- Validation
Make separate validation cases repo that contains testcases and results as branches
Also make a folder that contains parameters/files for specific case
Check CT and inflow distribution against BEMT for CarrNTung rotor

Effect of vortex core radius on wake structure
Add provision for coning for blades

Add induced velocity by other rotors to RHS  **VERY IMPORTANT**
- wing induced velocities by other rotors are neglected now
- this has to be performed in zeroth iteration also

Finish up calc_force subroutines properly
Make better selection switches for plotting gamma, alpha etc distributions
Check existence of plots in python before opening visit
convert src_plot files to correspond to argument names in plotit.py
