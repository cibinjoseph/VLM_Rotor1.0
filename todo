Max circulation at non max lift in forward flight?
Does discretization give rise to instability? cause for Kelvin waves or Crow instability?
Split Nwake and Fwake computations to separate loops to avoid if conditions
Get blade distributed parameters, at quarter chord maybe?
Make lift integration higher order - unequal intervals
Check oscillations in inflow - dependent on nInflowLocations
Check if vortex strain is overriding vortex core changes due to dissipation
Wake dissipation on extreme straining
Implement option to switch lift from alpha computation to postprocessing
Implement angle of attack estimation from sectional circulation
Try slow start for tandem wing to check for discrepancy
Use resultant filament gamma for rollup
