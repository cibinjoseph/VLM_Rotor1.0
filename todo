Max circulation at non max lift in forward flight?
Check leapfrogging in vortex rings - dependance on discretization
Does discretization give rise to instability? cause for Kelvin waves or Crow instability?
Check performance using VTune Amplifier and Advisor
Check CT and inflow distribution against BEMT
Split Nwake and Fwake computations to separate loops to avoid if conditions
Try slowstart to prevent starting vortex instability
Get blade distributed parameters, at quarter chord maybe?
Make lift integration higher order - unequal intervals
Check oscillations in inflow - dependent on nInflowLocations
