Max circulation at non max lift in forward flight?
Does discretization give rise to instability? cause for Kelvin waves or Crow instability?
Split Nwake and Fwake computations to separate loops to avoid if conditions
Make lift integration higher order - unequal intervals
Check oscillations in inflow - dependent on nInflowLocations
Check if vortex strain is overriding vortex core changes due to dissipation
Wake dissipation on extreme straining
Try slow start for tandem wing to check for discrepancy
Convert grid output to binary format
Implement non-lifting surfaces: 
- Use source induced velocity for non-lifting surfaces in vind
Resolve issue of blending multiple airfoils along span
Check sweep cases by KnP
While computing drag from FELS in unsteady case, ensure unsteady 'induced' drag term is not counted twice by neglecting it in force computation using gamma 
Introduce blade%xAxisNoPitch centered about pitching hinge
Implement alpha sweep mode
Make secDynamicPressure a variable also to prevent recomputing during plotting
Change slowstartNT to -revs and in rotorXX.in
Change rotorXX.in to geomXX.in
Unify fels scripts for fixed and rotary wings
