Max circulation at non max lift in forward flight?
Does discretization give rise to instability? cause for Kelvin waves or Crow instability?
Split Nwake and Fwake computations to separate loops to avoid if conditions
Try slowstart to prevent starting vortex instability
Get blade distributed parameters, at quarter chord maybe?
Make lift integration higher order - unequal intervals
Check oscillations in inflow - dependent on nInflowLocations
Check if vortex strain is overriding vortex core changes due to dissipation

Effect of vortex core radius on wake structure

Comparison of centroids of vorticity for rollup model

Wake smoothening / velocity limiter
Wake dissipation on extreme straining

When computing inflow, consider contribution from other panel bound vortices

Add provision for CL-alpha tables
