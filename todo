Max circulation at non max lift in forward flight?
Does discretization give rise to instability? cause for Kelvin waves or Crow instability?
Check performance using VTune Amplifier and Advisor
Split Nwake and Fwake computations to separate loops to avoid if conditions
Try slowstart to prevent starting vortex instability
Get blade distributed parameters, at quarter chord maybe?
Make lift integration higher order - unequal intervals
Check oscillations in inflow - dependent on nInflowLocations

- Validation
Convergence of CT w.r.t nc, ns

Effect of vortex core radius on wake structure
Add provision for coning for blades

Add provision for CL-alpha tables

Comparison of centroids of vorticity for rollup model
Check lsq2 overprediction of alpha for rotor case
