Max circulation at non max lift in forward flight?
Does discretization give rise to instability? cause for Kelvin waves or Crow instability?
Check oscillations in inflow - dependent on nInflowLocations
Check if vortex strain is overriding vortex core changes due to dissipation
Wake dissipation on extreme straining
Try slow start for tandem wing to check for discrepancy
Introduce blade%xAxisNoPitch centered about pitching hinge
Phase out invertGammaSign since it works incorrectly for cambered sections

TESTING & VALIDATION
- Implement Katz and Plotkin's fixed wing ground effect as a testcase
- Check sweep cases by KnP
- Validate Friedrich's unsteady rotor case

FELS
- While computing drag from FELS in unsteady case, ensure unsteady 'induced' drag term is not counted twice by neglecting it in force computation using gamma 
- Create output folder with nonlinear data
- Compute blade flap moment and rotor moments

LOW PRIORITY
- make run_prof and run_prof_dbg targets return run-time errors
- Check if intermmediate data structure for arrays of wake and far wake would make it easier to handle induced velocities and such.
- Alpha sweep mode
- Add provision for root vortex
- Implement non-lifting surfaces: 
-- Use source induced velocity for non-lifting surfaces in vind
- Convert grid output to binary format

HIGH PRIORITY
- Implement prescribed far-wake
-- test for hover and axial climb (try 5 bladed ELEVATE test case itself)
