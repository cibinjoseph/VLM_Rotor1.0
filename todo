Max circulation at non max lift in forward flight?
Does discretization give rise to instability? cause for Kelvin waves or Crow instability?
Check performance using VTune Amplifier and Advisor
Split Nwake and Fwake computations to separate loops to avoid if conditions
Try slowstart to prevent starting vortex instability
Get blade distributed parameters, at quarter chord maybe?
Make lift integration higher order - unequal intervals
Check oscillations in inflow - dependent on nInflowLocations

- Validation
Make separate validation cases repo that contains testcases and results as branches
Also make a folder that contains parameters/files for specific case
Check CT and inflow distribution against BEMT for CarrNTung rotor

Effect of vortex core radius on wake structure
Add provision for coning for blades

Check if lsq2 is creating problems
