Add far wake ageing to age_wake
Add far wake dissipation to dissipate_wake
Remove row_near from strain_wake()
Correct other schemes
Correct instability in PC2 scheme - check with VLM_Wing2.0 tip
check leapfrogging in vortex rings - dependance on discretization
does discretization give rise to instability? cause for Kelvin waves?
