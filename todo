Max circulation at non max lift in forward flight?
Does discretization give rise to instability? cause for Kelvin waves or Crow instability?
Check performance using VTune Amplifier and Advisor
Split Nwake and Fwake computations to separate loops to avoid if conditions
Try slowstart to prevent starting vortex instability
Get blade distributed parameters, at quarter chord maybe?
Make lift integration higher order - unequal intervals
Check oscillations in inflow - dependent on nInflowLocations
Check if vortex strain is overriding vortex core changes due to dissipation

- Validation
Convergence of CT w.r.t nc, ns

Effect of vortex core radius on wake structure
Add provision for coning for blades

Add provision for CL-alpha tables

Comparison of centroids of vorticity for rollup model
Check convergence of thrust history with nc for thurst(mean alf) and thrust(lsq alf)
Why thrust(mean alf) converges to different value than thrust(gamma) - discrepancy
Check convergence of thrust(gamma) for multiple values of near wake panels and nc

Check if interior angles are computed properly

Check slow change from climb to hover stabilises wake
Wake smoothening using skew
Wake dissipation on skew
Make turbulence disspation rotor dependent

Check if rVc is different for coincident filaments
