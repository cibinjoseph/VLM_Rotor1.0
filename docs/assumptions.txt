Positive pitch and positive omega produces negative circulation and vice versa used in:
- rotor_rollup() for gam_max 

Panels have subdivisions along chord and not inclined to it 
- blade_calcforce() for tangent vector

Max number of rotors is 99
- rotorNumberChar

Max number of blades for a rotor is 99
- bladeNumberChar

Rectangular blade with no sweep
- inflowLocations

Distance used is from hub centre rather than spanwise distance
- inflow2file, gamma2file

Force computation from alpha only gives lift
- blade_calc_force_gamma
