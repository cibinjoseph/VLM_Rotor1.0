An object-oriented, parallelized, unsteady vortex lattice solver for multi-rotor/wing analysis written in Fortran.

This solver was developed from scratch as part of my PhD to study rotorcraft aerodynamics. It was written to be as generalized as possible in order to handle aircraft configurations consisting of multiple wings and rotors. However, it is far from complete and is yet to develop into an easy-to-use software. For this reason, it is constantly evolving and users are encouraged to improve it if possible.
